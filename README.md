# Moving-Object-Detection-using-OpenCV
This is a repository to detect the moving object. Here I use laptops' primary camera to detect the moving object. It is a computer vision project, where OpneCV library is used for the whole project.

## Steps:
- Feed from the Camera.
- Have to capture the first image, which is later used as a background image
- Comparision between the background image and the current frame.
